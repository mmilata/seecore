LINUX CORE DUMP INFORMATION EXTRACTION TOOL
===========================================


PURPOSE

This package aims to provide easy access to the following data usually
available in a core dump:

 - Global variables (symbols & values).
 - Stacks of individual threads.
 - Local variables for each stack frame.
 - Mappings from virtual memory to file offsets in the core.

It has small subset of features of an actual debugger, but is somewhat more
lightweight and easier to use from another program.


USAGE

 - Data structures and functions are documented in the "seecore.h" header file.
 - Simple example that prints most of the extracted information is provided as
   "seecore.c" source file.
 - Compile together with your project or use in any way you consider best,
   there is no shared library as the disadvantages and work required outweighs
   the benefits.
 - There are two dependencies: elfutils [0] (any recent version) and
   libunwind [1] (at least version 1.1).


LIMITATIONS AND KNOWN BUGS

 - The support of DWARF primitives is far from complete as opposed to a REAL
   debugger, features are added as I stumble upon them. Let me know if you want
   to see something implemented (especially the DW_OP_foo operations, "unknown
   opcode").
 - Only C language is supported (compilation units in other language are
   skipped).
 - Only x86-64 architecture is supported, though adding support for another
   shouldn't be difficult. This (probably) applies both to the hosting computer
   as well as the computer that produced the core dump.
 - Shared libraries and external debugging information are searched for in
   standard places (and you have to have both, in the version that was used in
   the program that resulted in the core dump). This pretty much means that you
   can analyze only coredumps produced on your own system with no library
   upgrades in between. Again, this should not be difficult to change, as long
   as you have another way of supplying the right libraries and debuginfos
   needed.
